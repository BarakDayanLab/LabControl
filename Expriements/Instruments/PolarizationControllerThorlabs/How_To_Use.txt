how to use:
1. get into "\PolarizationControllerThorlabs" directory
2. in python 3.8 run "PolarizationControllerSetup.py build"
3. in python 3.8 run "PolarizationControllerSetup.py install" (this binds the functions from the dll's in c to python use)
4. use the function set3polarizers(paddle1_pos_input, paddle2_pos_input, paddle3_pos_input, serial_type).

note:
1. There is a phenomena of the device changing it's serial number. 
	always check the serial number at the kinesis software is the 
	same as in the code.
2. the code is composed of the following files:
	a. PolarizersThorlabs_Set.py - the main code you should run. you can also take the
		main function set3polarizers and use it in your code:
		set3polarizers(paddle1_pos_input, paddle2_pos_input, paddle3_pos_input, serial_type):
        # INPUT:
        # paddle1_pos_input - the desirable paddle 1 orientation. it must be a number between 1 and 170.
        # paddle2_pos_input - the desirable paddle 2 orientation. it must be a number between 1 and 170.
        # paddle3_pos_input - the desirable paddle 3 orientation. it must be a number between 1 and 170.

        # serial_type - is an integer representing the real serial number.
        # 1 - 38137764
        # 2 - 38133904
	b. Thorlabs_Kinesis directory
